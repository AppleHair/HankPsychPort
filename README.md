# FNF ONLINE VS. Hank Challenge - Psych Engine Port
This is a Psych Engine port of the first challenge in FNF ONLINE VS, the hank challenge (with the song's name being "Accelerant").

As of now, a lot of people already tried to port this challenge to psych, but most of these ports are rushed, inaccurate and 
straight-up garbage. People are busy porting the newer challenges and this one is being Left behind.
This port, however, is so accurate and well made, that I think it's safe to say that this is one of the most accurate
and well-coded psych engine ports to date.

Currently, the port is in a demo state and has only the hard difficulty implemented.
In the future, I hope to add the fucked difficulty and more new stuff that I want to make for this
port. There's just one problem, I don't know how much time that would take, because I'm going 
back to school soon, and if last year was difficult, THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE HELL!
So until I make the full version, I encourage other people in the community to try to make
a patch that adds fucked mode to this demo.

## The Process

You are probably going to be shocked by this, but I started working on this port approximately ONE YEAR AGO (as of writing this).
I was mostly inspired by the way the shaggy mod was ported to psych engine at the time and I wanted to give accelerant
a similar treatment, but I didn't have much experience with making FNF mods at the time, which explains why this port took so long
to make. I learned SO MUCH about programming this year that it's literally INSANE. Programming was always a thing I liked to do,
but now after I learned more about it, it has a lot more meaning to me, and I can't wait to learn even more!

## A Special Thanks To The Psych Engine Devs

As a person who saw the engine evolving Throughout this year, I have a lot of respect for the people who work on
psych engine and I know for certain that this port wouldn't have been the same without all of the features that have
been added and without the Lua API that was released just the day after I thought about making this port.
I want to thank all of the psych engine devs, contributors, and ESPECIALLY Shadow Mario, for making psych
engine what it is today!

## Tips For Porters

One of my objectives in making a well-coded and accurate psych engine port is to encourage other porters to make better
psych engine ports. I made many comments in my code that will probably help others understand what the code does and
its algorithm. In addition, I also put comments that give tips and suggestions for how to do certain things in the right way, 
and I also want to give some general tips right now.

My first tip is more programming related, and it's to understand what is happening in the source code when you write your code
in Lua. This kind of skill is very important to gain with every tool you use to make something and ESPECIALLY with psych engine.
Don't just assume the functions you use work like you think, and Instead, go to FunkinLua.hx and check exactly what the functions
you use do, and how they affect the game as a whole. Furthermore, understanding more things in the code that aren't necessarily
related to built-in Lua functions will open you to new possibilities and help you do more things in psych engine lua than you ever imagined!
This skill of being able to read the source code will also help you solve problems and bugs you face along the way and you'll be able to go to
the source code and try to understand what is causing the problem instead of attempting a lot of stuff for no reason.
So if you thought you don't need to understand the source code to make a psych engine lua mod, then think again!
It's also very important to mention that I don't recommend using the psych engine wiki, because it's very outdated
and doesn't get updates anymore.

My second tip is more about how I made the port accurate, and no, there's no magic trick.
making something accurate takes a lot of patience, and if you want to make something accurate,
you'll need a lot of patience, BUT because I know not everyone has this much patience, I don't think that every
port should be as accurate as this one. I think you should at least use the original version as a guideline and not 
just put sprites or set tween eases to whatever looks fine to you. I should also point out that if something looks broken 
because you tried to make it accurate, you should make it look good instead of making it accurate. balancing 
between making things accurate and making things good is the right way to make a port in my opinion.

My third tip is very simple, and it's to learn Lua properly. There's a really good website that
can help you with this. Here's the link:  https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html

Now, I want to clarify something. There are A LOT of talented people who use psych engine
Lua to do very cool things. I'M NOT TALKING TO THEM. I'm talking to people who want to make
a good psych engine port of another mod, and don't have enough knowledge to make it actually good, 
(and there are a lot of people that fit this description) and I want to help them.


## Feedback

If you have something to say about the port or find a bug/other problem with the port, please leave feedback in 
the comments of the mod's GameBanana page. I want this port to be the best it can be, and feedback will help with that a lot.
Even if you think something I said in the comments (the comments in the code) is incorrect or wrong in some way, feel free to correct me.

## Future Plans

Ok, so other than an accurate port of the fucked difficulty, I have some very 
cool and exciting things I'm planning to work on for the full release of the port:

	1) FNF ONLINE VS. Rating Screen Recreation:

		Starting with the one that excites me the most,
		this is going to be a recreation of the cool rating screen
		that appears in FNF ONLINE VS, and it's going to be very
		accurate and very cool, except the maximum accuracy you 
		will be able to get is 100% (no above 100% thing), and the
		Ss rank is going to be replaced with something else.
		maybe it'll be a "Perfect" rank instead.
		
	2) hank-player:

		A proper hank player with miss animations, game-over animations
		and any other animation that a player character in FNF usually has.

	3) maghank-player:

		Same with Mag-Hank.

	4) New Fucked Difficulty:

		I want to make my own interpretation of the fucked difficulty of Accelerant as 
		a separate download. I have some cool Ideas for new mechanics and new animations 
		and cutscenes that I want to add. This is going to be the more original side of the port.
